# St. Joseph's Montessori EdTech Platform

## 1. Project Idea

The St. Joseph's Montessori EdTech Platform is a comprehensive, modern, and user-centric school management system designed to streamline administrative tasks, enhance communication, and empower students, teachers, and administrators. It provides distinct, role-based portals that cater to the specific needs of each user group, all powered by a robust backend using Supabase for the database and authentication.

## 2. Setup and Deployment

### **Step 1: Local Environment Variables (`.env` file)**

First, to run the application on your local machine, create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add the keys below.

-   **`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`**: The public URL of your Supabase project. Found in your Supabase project's **Settings > API** section.
-   **`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`**: The public "anonymous" key for your Supabase project. This is safe to expose in the browser.
-   **`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`**: The secret "service role" key. **This is highly sensitive and must not be exposed to the browser.** It is used for server-side administrative actions.
-   **`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`**: The full URL of your deployed application (e.g., `https://sjm-school-app.vercel.app`). **This is critical for password reset and invitation links to work correctly.**
-   **`RESEND_API_KEY`**: (Optional) Your API key from [Resend](https://resend.com/) for sending emails.
-   **`EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`**: (Optional) The email address you want to send emails from (e.g., `noreply@yourdomain.com`).
-   **`GOOGLE_API_KEY`**: (Optional) Your API key for Google AI services (Gemini) for the AI Lesson Planner.
-   **`APP_MODE`**: (Optional) Set to `development` to enable features like showing temporary passwords on user registration. In production, it should be unset or set to `production`.


### **Step 2: Database Schema Setup (Crucial Step)**

After setting your environment variables, you **must** set up your Supabase database schema. The error `relation "public.app_settings" does not exist` means this step has not been completed.

1.  **Navigate to your Supabase Project.**
2.  Go to the **SQL Editor** in the sidebar.
3.  Open the `src/supabase/policies.md` file in this project.
4.  **Copy the entire content** of the `policies.md` file.
5.  **Paste the entire script** into the Supabase SQL Editor.
6.  Click **"Run"**. This will create all the necessary tables and security policies for the application to function correctly.

### **Step 3: Deploying to Vercel (IMPORTANT FIX)**

Your application will fail to build on Vercel if the environment variables are not set correctly in your Vercel project settings. The error `FATAL: Supabase Anon Key is not configured correctly` is a clear sign of this issue.

Your local `.env` file is **not** uploaded for security reasons. You must add the variables to Vercel manually.

1.  **Open Your Project in Vercel:**
    *   Log in to your Vercel account and navigate to your project dashboard.

2.  **Go to Settings -> Environment Variables:**
    *   Click on the **"Settings"** tab, then **"Environment Variables"** in the left sidebar.

3.  **Add Each Variable:**
    *   For each key from your `.env` file, add it here. **Copy and paste the names exactly** to avoid typos.

    | Key (Name)                    | Value                                          |
    | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
    | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`    | *Your project's Supabase URL*                  |
    | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | *Your project's Supabase anon key*             |
    | `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`   | *Your project's Supabase service role key*     |
    | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`        | *Your app's full production URL*               |
    | `GOOGLE_API_KEY`              | *(Optional) Your Google AI key*                |
    | `RESEND_API_KEY`              | *(Optional) Your Resend API key*               |
    | `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`          | *(Optional) Your "from" email address*         |

    *   After entering the Key and Value, **click the "Save" button** for each variable.

4.  **Redeploy the Application:**
    *   Go to the **"Deployments"** tab in your Vercel project.
    *   Click the **"..."** (three-dots menu) on the most recent deployment from your `main` branch and select **"Redeploy"**.

This will start a new build using the correct environment variables and will resolve the build error.
